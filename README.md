# Volatility-project

## Installation

## Description
Our project processes and analyses various macroeconomic data in the context of market volatility (approximated by VIX).

We let the user decide which data to plug in, but recommend using our tools to better capture relevant datasets. Our tools include PCA which ____, correlation matrix, where you can see correlations of various variables at the same time, and correlation function where you can quickly find correlation between 2 variables.

GARCH model ____

For better visualisation, we built interactive graph, where you can plug variables as per your liking. We also added a slider for you to be able to closely inspect different timeframes, and buttons for some of the most used timeframes. You are also able to create a snapshot of the graph when you reach to the upper right above the graph (alongside some other functions).
